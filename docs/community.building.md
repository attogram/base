# Community Building Guide

Building a healthy and effective community around your open source project is
just as important as writing good code.
A strong community can help with everything from finding bugs and adding new
features to supporting new users and promoting your project.

This guide provides best practices for fostering a positive and productive
community environment.

## 1. Create a Welcoming Environment

First impressions matter.
Newcomers should feel that their contributions are welcome and valued,
regardless of their skill level.

-   **Code of Conduct:** Adopt and enforce a
    [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
    This sets the tone for respectful and inclusive interactions.
-   **Contribution Guidelines:** Provide a clear
    [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md) file that explains how to get
    involved, from reporting bugs to submitting pull requests.
-   **Be Responsive:** Acknowledge new issues and pull requests promptly, even
    if it's just to say "thanks for the contribution, I'll review this soon."
-   **Celebrate Contributions:** Publicly thank contributors for their work.
    Consider using a tool like the
    [All Contributors](https://allcontributors.org/) bot to recognize all
    types of contributions, not just code.

## 2. Provide Clear and Accessible Documentation

Good documentation is the foundation of a healthy community.
It empowers users to solve their own problems and lowers the barrier to
contribution.

-   **README:** Your main `README.md` should be a clear and concise entry
    point to your project.
-   **Getting Started Guide:** Provide a step-by-step guide for setting up the
    development environment and running the project for the first time.
-   **API Reference:** If your project has an API, provide a comprehensive
    reference that is easy to navigate.
-   **Keep it Updated:** Ensure your documentation stays in sync with your
    codebase.
    Outdated documentation can be a major source of frustration for your
    community.

## 3. Establish Clear Communication Channels

Provide clear and accessible channels for your community to ask questions,
share ideas, and collaborate.

-   **GitHub Issues:** Use GitHub Issues for bug reports and feature requests.
-   **GitHub Discussions:** For more open-ended conversations, questions, and
    community announcements, enable
    [GitHub Discussions](./community.discussions.md).
-   **Other Channels:** Depending on your community's preferences, you might
    also consider a chat platform like Discord or Slack.
    Whatever you choose, make it clear where users should go for different
    types of communication.

## 4. Be a Good Steward

As a maintainer, your role is to guide the project and its community.

-   **Set a Vision:** Have a clear vision for the future of the project and
    communicate it to your community.
    A public roadmap can be a great way to do this.
-   **Be Open to Feedback:** Be willing to listen to your community's ideas and
    concerns, even if you don't always agree.
-   **Delegate:** As your community grows, you won't be able to do everything
    yourself.
    Empower trusted community members to help with tasks like triaging issues,
    reviewing pull requests, and moderating discussions.
-   **Lead by Example:** The tone and behavior of the maintainers will set the
    standard for the entire community.
    Be patient, respectful, and appreciative.

Building a community takes time and effort, but it's one of the most rewarding
aspects of running an open source project.
By creating a welcoming, well-documented, and communicative environment, you can
foster a community that will help your project thrive for years to come.

# Using GitHub Discussions

GitHub Discussions is a feature designed to be the community forum for your project, right alongside your code.
It provides a dedicated space for conversations, Q&A, and idea sharing, keeping your issue tracker clean and focused on actionable tasks.

## Issues vs. Discussions: What's the Difference?

Understanding when to use Issues and when to use Discussions is key to keeping your project organized.

- **GitHub Issues** are for tracking specific, actionable tasks. They have a clear "done" state.
  - **Use for:** Bug reports, feature requests with a clear scope, specific to-do items.
  - **Example:** "The login button is broken on Safari."

- **GitHub Discussions** are for open-ended conversations. They don't have a "done" state and are about exploration and communication.
  - **Use for:** Q&A, sharing ideas, general feedback, showing off what you've built.
  - **Example:** "What do you think about adding a dark mode?" or "How do I connect the app to a different database?"

By directing non-actionable conversations to Discussions, you prevent your issue tracker from becoming cluttered with questions and long debates, allowing you to focus on the work that needs to be done.

## How to Enable and Use Discussions

1.  **Enable Discussions:** In your repository settings, under the "Features" section, check the box for "Discussions."

2.  **Configure Categories:** Set up categories to organize your community's conversations. Good starting categories include:
    - **Announcements:** For maintainers to share project news.
    - **Q&A:** For users to ask questions. This category has a feature to mark an answer as correct.
    - **Ideas:** For proposing and debating new features.
    - **Show and Tell:** For community members to share what they've built with your project.

## Best Practices for Maintainers

1.  **Seed the Conversation:** When you first enable Discussions, post a welcome message or an announcement to get things started.

2.  **Be Active:** Participate in discussions, answer questions, and encourage community members. Your engagement sets the tone.

3.  **Moderate as Needed:** As with any community forum, be prepared to moderate to ensure conversations remain respectful and productive, in line with your [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

4.  **Convert Issues to Discussions:** If a user opens an issue that is actually a question or a broad idea, you can convert it to a discussion. This moves the conversation to the right place while preserving the content.

5.  **Convert Discussions to Issues:** Conversely, if a discussion evolves into a concrete, actionable task (like a well-defined feature request), you can create an issue directly from the discussion to track the work.

By embracing GitHub Discussions, you can foster a vibrant community, gather valuable feedback, and maintain a clean, organized workflow for managing your project's development.

# Using GitHub Discussions

GitHub Discussions is a powerful tool for building a community around your
project.
It provides a dedicated space for conversations that don't fit neatly into the
structured format of GitHub Issues.
Think of it as a forum or a message board that lives right alongside your code.

This guide explains how to enable and effectively use GitHub Discussions.

## Enabling Discussions

To enable Discussions for your repository:

1.  Navigate to your repository's main page on GitHub.
2.  Click on the **Settings** tab.
3.  Scroll down to the "Features" section.
4.  Check the box next to **Discussions**.

It may take a few moments, but a new "Discussions" tab will appear in your
repository's navigation bar.

## When to Use Discussions vs. Issues

It's important to guide your community on when to use Discussions and when to
use Issues.
Here's a common breakdown:

**Use GitHub Issues for:**

-   **Bug Reports:** Actionable reports of problems with your code.
-   **Feature Requests:** Specific requests for new functionality.
-   **Tasks:** Any item that has a clear "done" state.

**Use GitHub Discussions for:**

-   **Q&A:** Questions about how to use your project.
-   **Ideas:** Open-ended brainstorming and suggestions for new features.
-   **Show and Tell:** A place for community members to share what they've
    built with your project.
-   **Announcements:** A place for maintainers to share news and updates.

You can create categories in your Discussions to help organize these different
types of conversations.

## Best Practices for Managing Discussions

1.  **Seed Content:** When you first enable Discussions, it will be empty.
    Create a few posts to get the conversation started.
    You could post a "Welcome" message, an announcement, or a question to your
    community.

2.  **Promote It:** Let your community know that Discussions is the place to
    be.
    Link to it from your `README.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` files.
    If someone opens an issue that is better suited for a discussion, politely
    guide them to the correct place and, if possible, convert the issue to a
    discussion.

3.  **Mark Answers:** In Q&A categories, you can mark a comment as the
    accepted answer.
    This helps other users with the same question quickly find the solution.
    Encourage your community to help with this.

4.  **Moderate:** As with any online community, moderation is key.
    Ensure that conversations are respectful and stay on topic.
    Make sure your [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) is visible and
    enforced.

5.  **Engage:** Be an active participant in your community's discussions.
    Answer questions, provide feedback on ideas, and celebrate what your users
    are creating.

By providing a dedicated and well-managed space for conversation, GitHub
Discussions can help you build a more engaged, supportive, and collaborative
community.

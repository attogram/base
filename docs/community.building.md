# Community Building Guide

A thriving open-source project is built on a foundation of a healthy,
welcoming, and effective community.
Here are some best practices for fostering such an environment.

## 1. Establish a Code of Conduct

A [Code of Conduct](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) is a document that outlines the
expected standards of behavior for all community members.
It's a clear statement that your project is a safe and inclusive space.

- **Adopt a Standard:** You don't have to write one from scratch.
  The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is a
  widely used and respected choice.
  This repository includes a template to get you started.
- **Enforce It:** A Code of Conduct is only effective if it's enforced.
  Be prepared to act on reports of violations to protect your community.

## 2. Be Welcoming and Responsive

First impressions matter.
How you treat newcomers will determine whether they stick around.

- **Welcome Contributions:** Use a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file to explain how
  people can contribute.
  Thank contributors for their work, even if you don't merge it.
- **Be Responsive:** Respond to issues and pull requests in a timely manner.
  If you're busy, a quick "Thanks for the report, I'll look into this next
  week" is better than silence.

## 3. Provide Clear Communication Channels

Designate specific places for different types of community interaction.

- **GitHub Issues:** Use issues for actionable tasks like bug reports and
  feature requests.
  This repository's [issue templates](./.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/) help
  structure this process.
- **GitHub Discussions:** Enable
  [GitHub Discussions](https://docs.github.com/en/discussions) for open-ended
  conversations, Q&A, and sharing ideas.
  This keeps your issue tracker focused.
- **Other Channels:** Consider a chat platform like Slack or Discord for more
  informal community interaction, but be mindful of the moderation overhead.

## 4. Document Everything

Good documentation is a cornerstone of a healthy community.
It empowers users to solve their own problems and lowers the barrier to
contribution.

- **User Guides:** Write clear, concise guides for using your project.
- **Reference Material:** Provide detailed documentation for APIs,
  configuration options, and other technical aspects.
- **Contribution Guidelines:** Your `CONTRIBUTING.md` should clearly explain
  how to set up a development environment, run tests, and submit changes.

## 5. Empower Your Community

As your community grows, look for opportunities to empower trusted members.

- **Recognize Contributors:** Acknowledge valuable contributions publicly.
  This could be through release notes, social media shout-outs, or a
  contributors list in your README.
- **Delegate Responsibility:** Invite experienced community members to help
  triage issues, review pull requests, or moderate discussion channels.

Building a community takes time and effort, but it's one of the most
rewarding aspects of maintaining an open-source project.
By being intentional about creating a positive and productive environment, you
can build a project that lasts.

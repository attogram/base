# Project Launch Checklist

Launching a new open-source project can be a daunting task.
This checklist is designed to help you ensure a smooth and successful launch.

## Pre-Launch

This is the phase where you prepare your project for its public debut.

### Code and Repository

- [ ] Finalize initial feature set for `v1.0.0`.
- [ ] Write comprehensive tests and ensure they are all passing.
- [ ] Set up CI/CD workflows for testing and linting.
- [ ] Polish the codebase: remove commented-out code, fix typos, and ensure
  consistent styling.
- [ ] Run a security audit (e.g., check dependencies for known
  vulnerabilities).

### Documentation

- [ ] Write a clear and compelling `README.md`.
- [ ] Create a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file with guidelines for contributors.
- [ ] Add a `LICENSE` file (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0).
- [ ] Write user guides and API reference documentation.
- [ ] Add a `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` to set community standards.

### Community & Marketing

- [ ] Prepare a blog post or announcement for the launch.
- [ ] Identify communities (e.g., Reddit, Hacker News, specific forums) where
  you will share your project.
- [ ] Create a project website or landing page (GitHub Pages is a great
  option).
- [ ] Set up social media accounts if desired.

## Launch Day

The day you make your project public.

- [ ] **Publish your code:** Make your GitHub repository public.
- [ ] **Push the `v1.0.0` tag:** This will trigger your automated release
  workflow.
  ```bash
  git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Initial public release"
  git push origin main --tags
  ```
- [ ] **Monitor for feedback:** Keep a close eye on GitHub issues, social
  media, and other channels for questions and bug reports.
- [ ] **Be responsive:** Engage with early adopters, answer questions, and
  thank them for their interest.

## Post-Launch

The work doesn't stop after launch day.
Now it's about building momentum.

### Short-Term (First Week)

- [ ] Triage and fix critical bugs reported by early users.
- [ ] Publish a `v1.0.1` patch release if necessary.
- [ ] Thank the community for the feedback and support.
- [ ] Share any positive press or comments.

### Long-Term (First Month and Beyond)

- [ ] Continue to be responsive to issues and pull requests.
- [ ] Start working on the features planned for `v1.1.0`.
- [ ] Nurture your community by empowering contributors (see the
  [Community Building Guide](./community-building-guide.md)).
- [ ] Set up a regular release cadence.
- [ ] Periodically review and update your documentation.

This checklist is a starting point.
Feel free to adapt it to the specific needs of your project.
Good luck with your launch!
